# Zifi Detector

A simple webapp that was used in the 2022 Summer Camp for the Louveteaux.

This allows a device (preferrably a tablet) to tap on the side of the screens to update the position and is imilar to a "Hot - Cold" kind of game, where the bigger the ring is, the closer you are to your target.

The rings shows up with a sound every 2 minutes for around 30 seconds, allowing the kids to determine wheter they are getting closer or farther.

Tapping the top of the screen allows for the device / tablet holder to get a glance at which step they are in as it can be confusing. Tapping again hides it back again, if waiting 5 seconds is too much or a curious kid is nearby.
